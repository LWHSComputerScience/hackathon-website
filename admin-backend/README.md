### Preparing the data
Create a folder named private

Place volunteer and attendee CSVs in the private folder named attendees.csv and volunteers.csv

Download a Firebase Admin SDK file and place it in the file. 

Rename the SDK file to auth.json

### Uploading the data
After preparing the data, make sure you have the latest version of node and npm installed

Run npm i to install the dependencies

**IMPORTANT** The upload program will add all of the entries in the CSVs to the existing database. If you want to clear the database run npm run clear

Run npm run upload
